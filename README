This is a bookmarklet to use Flickr's machine tag to pull
in the geodata. This is much more impressive when the geodata
itself is not already on the page. 

Currently supported machine tags:
* foodspotting

To be supported:
* yelp
* foursquare
* etc, etc, etc

To use, create a new bookmark with this as the URL:
javascript:(function(){var e=document;var a=e.body;var c=e.createElement("script");c.src="https://nolancaudill.com/projects/machinetaggeo/machinetaggeo-min.js?"+(new Date().getTime());a.appendChild(c)})();

A good first page to look at is Flickr's own, Chris Martin:
