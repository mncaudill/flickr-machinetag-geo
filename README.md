This is a bookmarklet to use Flickr's machine tag to pull
in the geodata. This is much more impressive when the geodata
itself is not already on the page. 

This project is *very* alpha--there is very little error-checking. It also only works on semi-modern browsers that support JS's querySelectorAll.

This project was completely inspired by Aaron Cope's [post][post].

Currently supported machine tags:

* foodspotting
* foursquare
* last.fm (both events and venues)
* dopplr
* openplaques
* noticin.gs

To be supported:

* yelp
* etc, etc, etc

Check out [the project page][project_page] for the draggable bookmarklet.

A good first page to look at is Flickr's own, Chris Martin: [Foodspotting example][foodspotting_example]
